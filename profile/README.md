# 30 seconds of code

30 seconds of code is an accessible high-quality knowledge base for developers of all skill levels, established in 2017. Since then, we have created hundreds of short code snippets and programming articles with the help of a large community of contributors. Our goal is to make software development more accessible and help the open source community thrive by helping people learn to code.
