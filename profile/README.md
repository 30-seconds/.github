# 30 seconds of code

30 seconds of code is an accessible high-quality knowledge base for developers of all skill levels, established in 2017. Since then, we have created hundreds of short code snippets and programming articles with the help of a large community of contributors. Our goal is to make software development more accessible and help the open source community thrive by helping people learn to code. 

This organization has been archived. To follow the project, please visit [the website](https://30secondsofcode.org) or [the repository](https://github.com/Chalarangelo/30-seconds-of-code).
